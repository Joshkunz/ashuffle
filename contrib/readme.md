# contributed instructions/code

All code in this `contrib` directory was created by users of ashuffle, and
is provided here as part of ashuffle's source to make it easier for other
ashuffle users to find. The code or instructions in this directory are not
"officially supported", and they may be wrong or out of date.

Each folder in this directory represents a "topic", and the associated
code, and instructions are contained within. For example, information about
running ashuffle using systemd, can be found in the `systemd` directory.
Most directories should have a `readme.md` file in the root explaining the
provided code and how to use it.

Feel free to open a PR with additional resources if you find something you
think other ashuffle users would also find useful.
